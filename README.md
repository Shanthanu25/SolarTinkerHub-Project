### Project Description
The Solarize Your Life Goals app is a tongue-in-cheek project that takes user-inputted life ambitions (like ‚Äúbecome a rockstar‚Äù or ‚Äúlearn to speak whale‚Äù) and calculates the amount of imaginary solar energy needed to achieve these dreams. Every life goal, no matter how simple or complex, is hilariously ‚Äúsolarized‚Äù into an energy unit‚Äîproving just how much sunshine (in kWh) your dreams require!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Today, people underestimate the ‚Äúsolar power‚Äù needed to achieve life goals. How much energy is required to ‚Äúrun a marathon‚Äù or ‚Äúlaunch a cat into space‚Äù? The world deserves to know these pointless but highly amusing calculations!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
With the Solarize Your Life Goals app, we calculate the solar energy required for any goal. By taking into account factors like the absurdity of the goal, location-based solar potential, and made-up ‚Äúdream resistance,‚Äù we provide users with a unique and completely impractical answer to life‚Äôs biggest questions

The app's workflow begins with user entry on a splash screen, followed by a User Info Form for name, location, and time preferences. Users then enter their goal into the Goal Calculator, which provides a humorous "solar energy needed" calculation with preset goals and custom metrics for a fun, interactive experience.



### Project Demo

This demo video showcases the Solarize My Goals app, designed to entertain users by calculating the ‚Äúsolar energy‚Äù they‚Äôd need to accomplish any life goal in the most absurd and amusing way. The video starts with the User Entry at the splash screen, leading to the User Info Form where users input their name, location, and time preferences. Next, users enter or choose a goal, triggering the Goal Calculator to provide a custom energy estimate based on the unique "solar requirements" for each ambition. This includes a mix of preset goals and tailored inputs, displayed with a lively summary of solar energy metrics. The video wraps up by highlighting energy calculation, making the entire experience both innovative and entertainingly useless.
