### Project Description
The Solarize Your Life Goals app is a tongue-in-cheek project that takes user-inputted life ambitions (like ‚Äúbecome a rockstar‚Äù or ‚Äúlearn to speak whale‚Äù) and calculates the amount of imaginary solar energy needed to achieve these dreams. Every life goal, no matter how simple or complex, is hilariously ‚Äúsolarized‚Äù into an energy unit‚Äîproving just how much sunshine (in kWh) your dreams require!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Today, people underestimate the ‚Äúsolar power‚Äù needed to achieve life goals. How much energy is required to ‚Äúrun a marathon‚Äù or ‚Äúlaunch a cat into space‚Äù? The world deserves to know these pointless but highly amusing calculations!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
With the Solarize Your Life Goals app, we calculate the solar energy required for any goal. By taking into account factors like the absurdity of the goal, location-based solar potential, and made-up ‚Äúdream resistance,‚Äù we provide users with a unique and completely impractical answer to life‚Äôs biggest questions
